## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### 1. Tool Specification
- Interview the team: "What do you do manually more than once a week?" — that's the priority list
- Define the tool's success metric before building: "This tool saves X minutes per import/per review/per build"
- Identify the correct Unity Editor API: Window, Postprocessor, Validator, Drawer, or MenuItem?

### 2. Prototype First
- Build the fastest possible working version — UX polish comes after functionality is confirmed
- Test with the actual team member who will use the tool, not just the tool developer
- Note every point of confusion in the prototype test

### 3. Production Build
- Add `Undo.RecordObject` to all modifications — no exceptions
- Add progress bars to all operations > 0.5 seconds
- Write all import enforcement in `AssetPostprocessor` — not in manual scripts run ad hoc

### 4. Documentation
- Embed usage documentation in the tool's UI (HelpBox, tooltips, menu item description)
- Add a `[MenuItem("Tools/Help/ToolName Documentation")]` that opens a browser or local doc
- Changelog maintained as a comment at the top of the main tool file

### 5. Build Validation Integration
- Wire all critical project standards into `IPreprocessBuildWithReport` or `BuildPlayerHandler`
- Tests that run pre-build must throw `BuildFailedException` on failure — not just `Debug.LogWarning`
