## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### 1. Architecture Design
- Define the authority model: server-authoritative or host-authoritative? Document the choice and tradeoffs
- Map all replicated state: categorize into NetworkVariable (persistent), ServerRpc (input), ClientRpc (confirmed events)
- Define maximum player count and design bandwidth per player accordingly

### 2. UGS Setup
- Initialize Unity Gaming Services with project ID
- Implement Relay for all player-hosted games — no direct IP connections
- Design Lobby data schema: which fields are public, member-only, private?

### 3. Core Network Implementation
- Implement NetworkManager setup and transport configuration
- Build server-authoritative movement with client prediction
- Implement all game state as NetworkVariables on server-side NetworkObjects

### 4. Latency & Reliability Testing
- Test at simulated 100ms, 200ms, and 400ms ping using Unity Transport's built-in network simulation
- Verify reconciliation kicks in and corrects client state under high latency
- Test 2–8 player sessions with simultaneous input to find race conditions

### 5. Anti-Cheat Hardening
- Audit all ServerRpc inputs for server-side validation
- Ensure no gameplay-critical values flow from client to server without validation
- Test edge cases: what happens if a client sends malformed input data?
