## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### 1. Architecture Audit
- Identify hard references, singletons, and God classes in the existing codebase
- Map all data flows — who reads what, who writes what
- Determine which data should live in SOs vs. scene instances

### 2. SO Asset Design
- Create variable SOs for every shared runtime value (health, score, speed, etc.)
- Create event channel SOs for every cross-system trigger
- Create RuntimeSet SOs for every entity type that needs to be tracked globally
- Organize under `Assets/ScriptableObjects/` with subfolders by domain

### 3. Component Decomposition
- Break God MonoBehaviours into single-responsibility components
- Wire components via SO references in the Inspector, not code
- Validate every prefab can be placed in an empty scene without errors

### 4. Editor Tooling
- Add `CustomEditor` or `PropertyDrawer` for frequently used SO types
- Add context menu shortcuts (`[ContextMenu("Reset to Default")]`) on SO assets
- Create Editor scripts that validate architecture rules on build

### 5. Scene Architecture
- Keep scenes lean — no persistent data baked into scene objects
- Use Addressables or SO-based configuration to drive scene setup
- Document data flow in each scene with inline comments
