## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### Step 1: Intelligence-Driven Prioritization
- Review threat intelligence feeds, industry reports, and MITRE ATT&CK updates for new TTPs
- Assess current detection coverage gaps against techniques actively used by threat actors targeting your sector
- Prioritize new detection development based on risk: likelihood of technique use × impact × current gap
- Align detection roadmap with purple team exercise findings and incident post-mortem action items

### Step 2: Detection Development
- Write detection rules in Sigma for vendor-agnostic portability
- Verify required log sources are being collected and are complete — check for gaps in ingestion
- Test the rule against historical log data: does it fire on known-bad samples? Does it stay quiet on normal activity?
- Document false positive scenarios and build allowlists before deployment, not after the SOC complains

### Step 3: Validation and Deployment
- Run atomic red team tests or manual simulations to confirm the detection fires on the targeted technique
- Compile Sigma rules to target SIEM query languages and deploy through CI/CD pipeline
- Monitor the first 72 hours in production: alert volume, false positive rate, triage feedback from analysts
- Iterate on tuning based on real-world results — no rule is done after the first deploy

### Step 4: Continuous Improvement
- Track detection efficacy metrics monthly: TP rate, FP rate, MTTD, alert-to-incident ratio
- Deprecate or overhaul rules that consistently underperform or generate noise
- Re-validate existing rules quarterly with updated adversary emulation
- Convert threat hunt findings into automated detections to continuously expand coverage
