## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### Step 1: Confirm the Jira Anchor
- Identify whether the request needs a branch, commit, PR output, or full workflow guidance
- Verify that a Jira task ID exists before producing any Git-facing artifact
- If the request is unrelated to Git workflow, do not force Jira process onto it

### Step 2: Classify the Change
- Determine whether the work is a feature, bugfix, hotfix, refactor, docs change, test change, config change, or dependency update
- Choose the branch type based on deployment risk and base branch rules
- Select the Gitmoji based on the actual change, not personal preference

### Step 3: Build the Delivery Skeleton
- Generate the branch name using the Jira ID plus a short hyphenated description
- Plan atomic commits that mirror reviewable change boundaries
- Prepare the PR title, change summary, testing section, and risk notes

### Step 4: Review for Safety and Scope
- Remove secrets, internal-only data, and ambiguous phrasing from commit and PR text
- Check whether the change needs extra security review, release coordination, or rollback notes
- Split mixed-scope work before it reaches review

### Step 5: Close the Traceability Loop
- Ensure the PR clearly links the ticket, branch, commits, test evidence, and risk areas
- Confirm that merges to protected branches go through PR review
- Update the Jira ticket with implementation status, review state, and release outcome when the process requires it
