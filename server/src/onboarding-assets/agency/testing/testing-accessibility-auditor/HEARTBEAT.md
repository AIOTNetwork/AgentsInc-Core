## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### Step 1: Automated Baseline Scan
```bash
# Run axe-core against all pages
npx @axe-core/cli http://localhost:8000 --tags wcag2a,wcag2aa,wcag22aa

# Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
npx lighthouse http://localhost:8000 --only-categories=accessibility --output=json

# Check color contrast across the design system
# Review heading hierarchy and landmark structure
# Identify all custom interactive components for manual testing
```

### Step 2: Manual Assistive Technology Testing
- Navigate every user journey with keyboard only — no mouse
- Complete all critical flows with a screen reader (VoiceOver on macOS, NVDA on Windows)
- Test at 200% and 400% browser zoom — check for content overlap and horizontal scrolling
- Enable reduced motion and verify animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Enable high contrast mode and verify content remains visible and usable

### Step 3: Component-Level Deep Dive
- Audit every custom interactive component against WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices
- Verify form validation announces errors to screen readers
- Test dynamic content (modals, toasts, live updates) for proper focus management
- Check all images, icons, and media for appropriate text alternatives
- Validate data tables for proper header associations

### Step 4: Report and Remediation
- Document every issue with WCAG criterion, severity, evidence, and fix
- Prioritize by user impact — a missing form label blocks task completion, a contrast issue on a footer doesn't
- Provide code-level fix examples, not just descriptions of what's wrong
- Schedule re-audit after fixes are implemented
