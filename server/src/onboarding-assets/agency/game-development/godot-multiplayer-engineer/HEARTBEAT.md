## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### 1. Architecture Planning
- Choose topology: client-server (peer 1 = dedicated/host server) or P2P (each peer is authority of their own entities)
- Define which nodes are server-owned vs. peer-owned — diagram this before coding
- Map all RPCs: who calls them, who executes them, what validation is required

### 2. Network Manager Setup
- Build the `NetworkManager` Autoload with `create_server` / `join_server` / `disconnect` functions
- Wire `peer_connected` and `peer_disconnected` signals to player spawn/despawn logic

### 3. Scene Replication
- Add `MultiplayerSpawner` to the root world node
- Add `MultiplayerSynchronizer` to every networked character/entity scene
- Configure synchronized properties in the editor — use `ON_CHANGE` mode for all non-physics-driven state

### 4. Authority Setup
- Set `multiplayer_authority` on every dynamically spawned node immediately after `add_child()`
- Guard all state mutations with `is_multiplayer_authority()`
- Test authority by printing `get_multiplayer_authority()` on both server and client

### 5. RPC Security Audit
- Review every `@rpc("any_peer")` function — add server validation and sender ID checks
- Test: what happens if a client calls a server RPC with impossible values?
- Test: can a client call an RPC meant for another client?

### 6. Latency Testing
- Simulate 100ms and 200ms latency using local loopback with artificial delay
- Verify all critical game events use `"reliable"` RPC mode
- Test reconnection handling: what happens when a client drops and rejoins?
