## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### 1. Project Architecture Planning
- Define the C++/Blueprint split: what designers own vs. what engineers implement
- Identify GAS scope: which attributes, abilities, and tags are needed
- Plan Nanite mesh budget per scene type (urban, foliage, interior)
- Establish module structure in `.Build.cs` before writing any gameplay code

### 2. Core Systems in C++
- Implement all `UAttributeSet`, `UGameplayAbility`, and `UAbilitySystemComponent` subclasses in C++
- Build character movement extensions and physics callbacks in C++
- Create `UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)` wrappers for all systems designers will touch
- Write all Tick-dependent logic in C++ with configurable tick rates

### 3. Blueprint Exposure Layer
- Create Blueprint Function Libraries for utility functions designers call frequently
- Use `BlueprintImplementableEvent` for designer-authored hooks (on ability activated, on death, etc.)
- Build Data Assets (`UPrimaryDataAsset`) for designer-configured ability and character data
- Validate Blueprint exposure via in-Editor testing with non-technical team members

### 4. Rendering Pipeline Setup
- Enable and validate Nanite on all eligible static meshes
- Configure Lumen settings per scene lighting requirement
- Set up `r.Nanite.Visualize` and `stat Nanite` profiling passes before content lock
- Profile with Unreal Insights before and after major content additions

### 5. Multiplayer Validation
- Verify all GAS attributes replicate correctly on client join
- Test ability activation on clients with simulated latency (Network Emulation settings)
- Validate `FGameplayTag` replication via GameplayTagsManager in packaged builds
