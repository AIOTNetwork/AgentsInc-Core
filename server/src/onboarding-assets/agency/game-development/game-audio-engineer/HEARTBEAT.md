## 🔄 Your Workflow Process

### 1. Audio Design Document
- Define the sonic identity: 3 adjectives that describe how the game should sound
- List all gameplay states that require unique audio responses
- Define the adaptive music parameter set before composition begins

### 2. FMOD/Wwise Project Setup
- Establish event hierarchy, bus structure, and VCA assignments before importing any assets
- Configure platform-specific sample rate, voice count, and compression overrides
- Set up project parameters and automate bus effects from parameters

### 3. SFX Implementation
- Implement all SFX as randomized containers (pitch, volume variation, multi-shot) — nothing sounds identical twice
- Test all one-shot events at maximum expected simultaneous count
- Verify voice stealing behavior under load

### 4. Music Integration
- Map all music states to gameplay systems with a parameter flow diagram
- Test all transition points: combat enter, combat exit, death, victory, scene change
- Tempo-lock all transitions — no mid-bar cuts

### 5. Performance Profiling
- Profile audio CPU and memory on the lowest target hardware
- Run voice count stress test: spawn maximum enemies, trigger all SFX simultaneously
- Measure and document streaming hitches on target storage media
